# Set GnuPG ID that should be used for signing the reprepro repository.
# Expected format: DEADBEEF
# KEY_ID=

# If TRUNK_RELEASE is set then the package(s) of the repository
# receiving the packages that are built will be copied to the
# repository specified in TRUNK_RELEASE. This provides the option
# to have all recent versions of packages in a central repository.
# TRUNK_RELEASE='release-trunk'

# If packages are build for more than one architecture you can
# decide which architecture should build the "Architecture: all"
# packages. On all other architectures only the arch specific
# packages will be build then.
# If unset it will default to the architecture of the host system.
# MAIN_ARCHITECTURE="amd64"

# Hook scripts for pbuilder/cowbuilder, used e.g. for autopkgtest.
# Default:
# PBUILDER_HOOKDIR=/usr/share/jenkins-debian-glue/pbuilder-hookdir/

# Base directory for reprepro repositories
# Default:
# REPOSITORY='/srv/repository'

# If $release is set then "${REPOSITORY}/release/${release}"
# is used as release repository. If you want to use a different
# directory set RELEASE_REPOSITORY accordingly.
# Default:
# RELEASE_REPOSITORY="${REPOSITORY}/release/${release}"

# Remove packages from a $release before processing incoming
# This allows to rebuild and provide versions already existent
# in the release repository they are built for.
# Default:
# REMOVE_FROM_RELEASE=false
