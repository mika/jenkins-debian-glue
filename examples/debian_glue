# Example configuration file for the jenkins-debian-glue software.
# Install this file as /etc/jenkins/debian_glue to enable it.

# Set GnuPG ID that should be used for signing the reprepro repository.
# If you build packages for Squeeze your reprepro repositories *MUST* be
# signed and the keyring that holds the public key (REPOSITORY_KEYRING)
# must be set.
# Expected format: DEADBEEF
# KEY_ID=

# If TRUNK_RELEASE is set then the package(s) of the repository
# receiving the packages that are built will be copied to the
# repository specified in TRUNK_RELEASE. This provides the option
# to have all recent versions of packages in a central repository.
# TRUNK_RELEASE='release-trunk'

# If packages are build for more than one architecture you can
# decide which architecture should build the "Architecture: all"
# packages. On all other architectures only the arch specific
# packages will be build then.
# If unset it will default to the architecture of the host system.
# MAIN_ARCHITECTURE="amd64"

# Hook scripts for pbuilder/cowbuilder, used e.g. for autopkgtest.
# Default:
# PBUILDER_HOOKDIR=/usr/share/jenkins-debian-glue/pbuilder-hookdir/

# To enable a pbuilder configuration file for usage as documented
# in man pbuilder(8) under --configfile set this option.
# By default no user specific pbuilder configuration file is used.
# PBUILDER_CONFIG=/etc/jenkins/pbuilderrc

# Base directory for reprepro repositories, can be overwritten
# via REPOSITORY on demand
# Default:
# DEFAULT_REPOSITORY='/srv/repository'

# In order to keep the build versions unique and to ensure that there
# are no duplicates, the version number from the changelog is padded
# with the date and the build number.
# To override this behaviour and preserve the version number from the
# changelog, set USE_ORIG_VERSION to true.
# USE_ORIG_VERSION=true

# By default reprepro repositories are not verified but assumed to be
# trustworthy.
# Please note that if you build packages for Squeeze, the reprepro
# repositories *MUST* be signed and verifiable. I.e. you need to set
# KEY_ID and the corresponding keyring in REPOSITORY_KEYRING that
# holds the public key portion for that KEY_ID.
# REPOSITORY_KEYRING=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/my-custom-keyring.gpg

# If $release is set then "${REPOSITORY}/release/${release}"
# is used as release repository. If you want to use a different
# directory set RELEASE_REPOSITORY accordingly.
# Default:
# RELEASE_REPOSITORY="${REPOSITORY}/release/${release}"

# Remove packages from a $release before processing incoming
# This allows to rebuild and provide versions already existent
# in the release repository they are built for.
# Default:
# REMOVE_FROM_RELEASE=false

# By default the underlying build system (cowbuilder/pbuilder)
# automatically destroys the build environment, even if building
# fails for whatever reason. If DEB_KEEP_BUILD_ENV is set then
# a copy of the build environment is created under
# /var/cache/pbuilder/build/debug.$JOBNAME
# Please be aware that those build environments usually require
# quite some disk space, so do not forget to remove them.
# If unset the build environment won't be kept if building fails.
# DEB_KEEP_BUILD_ENV=true

# Comma separated list of extra repositories for resolving dependencies.
# Usage example:
# REPOSITORY_EXTRA='deb http://security.debian.org/ wheezy/updates main,deb-src http://security.debian.org/ wheezy/updates main'
# Default:
# REPOSITORY_EXTRA=

# Comma separated list of URLs with keys for extra repositories.
# Usage example:
# REPOSITORY_EXTRA_KEYS='http://foorepo.domain.com/key1.gpg,http://barrepo.domain.com/key2.gpg'
# Default:
# REPOSITORY_EXTRA_KEYS=

# autopkgtests are executed automatically inside the cowbuilder environment by
# default, corresponding to the ADT='internal' setting or if ADT is unset.
# To execute autopkgtests also externally you need to set ADT to
# either 'external' (no internal runs) or 'all' (internal + external runs).
# The external autopkgtests depend on a configured ADT_RUNNER setting.
# To skip internal as well as external autopkgtests set ADT='skip'.
# Usage example (see adt-virt-qemu(1) for details regarding image setup):
# ADT='external'
# ADT_RUNNER="adt-virt-qemu /srv/adt-${distribution:-}-${architecture:-}.img"
# Default:
# ADT=

# Control usage of eatmydata to speed up builds. If eatmydata is present on the
# host system and when building for a recent distribution (Debian/jessie +
# Ubuntu/vivid or newer) eatmydata is enabled automatically.
# To force its usage (skipping any host + distribution checks) set it to 'true'.
# To disable its usage set it to 'false'.
# USE_EATMYDATA=true

# Enable ccache (compiler cache for fast recompilation of C/C++ code)
# to speed up builds.
# USE_CCACHE=true

# Specify the format (as accepted by the 'date' command) for the generated
# build timestamp.
# Default: %Y%m%d%H%M%S
# TIMESTAMP_FORMAT="%Y%m%d%H%M%S"

# In case you are explicitly marking your new package version as "UNRELEASED"
# inside the debian/changelog file, you may not get a package build version
# number containing the SCM commit. Set this to 'true' in order to work around
# this.
# Default: false
# UNRELEASED_APPEND_COMMIT=false
