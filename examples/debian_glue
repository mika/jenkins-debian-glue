# Example configuration file for the jenkins-debian-glue software.
# Install this file as /etc/jenkins/debian_glue to enable it.

# Set GnuPG ID that should be used for signing the reprepro repository.
# If you build packages for Squeeze your reprepro repositories *MUST* be
# signed and the keyring that holds the public key (REPOSITORY_KEYRING)
# must be set.
# Expected format: DEADBEEF
# KEY_ID=

# If TRUNK_RELEASE is set then the package(s) of the repository
# receiving the packages that are built will be copied to the
# repository specified in TRUNK_RELEASE. This provides the option
# to have all recent versions of packages in a central repository.
# TRUNK_RELEASE='release-trunk'

# If packages are build for more than one architecture you can
# decide which architecture should build the "Architecture: all"
# packages. On all other architectures only the arch specific
# packages will be build then.
# If unset it will default to the architecture of the host system.
# MAIN_ARCHITECTURE="amd64"

# Hook scripts for pbuilder/cowbuilder, used e.g. for autopkgtest.
# Default:
# PBUILDER_HOOKDIR=/usr/share/jenkins-debian-glue/pbuilder-hookdir/

# To enable a pbuilder configuration file for usage as documented
# in man pbuilder(8) under --configfile set this option.
# By default no user specific pbuilder configuration file is used.
# PBUILDER_CONFIG=/etc/jenkins/pbuilderrc

# Base directory for reprepro repositories
# Default:
# REPOSITORY='/srv/repository'

# By default reprepro repositories are not verified but assumed to be
# trustworthy.
# Please note that if you build packages for Squeeze, the reprepro
# repositories *MUST* be signed and verifiable. I.e. you need to set
# KEY_ID and the corresponding keyring in REPOSITORY_KEYRING that
# holds the public key portion for that KEY_ID.
# REPOSITORY_KEYRING=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/my-custom-keyring.gpg

# If $release is set then "${REPOSITORY}/release/${release}"
# is used as release repository. If you want to use a different
# directory set RELEASE_REPOSITORY accordingly.
# Default:
# RELEASE_REPOSITORY="${REPOSITORY}/release/${release}"

# Remove packages from a $release before processing incoming
# This allows to rebuild and provide versions already existent
# in the release repository they are built for.
# Default:
# REMOVE_FROM_RELEASE=false

# By default the underlying build system (cowbuilder/pbuilder)
# automatically destroys the build environment, even if building
# fails for whatever reason. If DEB_KEEP_BUILD_ENV is set then
# a copy of the build environment is created under
# /var/cache/pbuilder/build/debug.$JOBNAME
# Please be aware that those build environments usually require
# quite some disk space, so do not forget to remove them.
# If unset the build environment won't be kept if building fails.
# DEB_KEEP_BUILD_ENV=true
