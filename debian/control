Description: Jenkins Debian glue scripts
 This package provides scripts which make building Debian
 packages inside Jenkins (a Continuous Integration suite) easier.
 .
 It's meant to make Q/A builds of Debian packages inside Jenkins
 as manageable and homogeneous as possible.

 You need to install the according packaging tools, depending on
 your VCS type and the features you want to use. To get all tools
 you can just install the jenkins-debian-glue-buildenv package.
